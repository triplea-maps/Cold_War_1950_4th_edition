<h1>Cold War 1950 </h1> <br> <br>     <b> Created by: Tim H. </b> <br>      Cold War, 1950.  Based somewhat on rational statistics of the period, utilizing the Pact of Steel scenario.  This scenario assumes the Korean War broadened into WWIII, with some areas having already been conquered - Korea and Indochina by China, Greece and Turkey by Warsaw_Pact, and S. America lining up behind America, Spain and Sweden joining Nato, and India accepting UK command..  I hope it is enjoyable.I welcome constructive criticism at thackenmiller@comcast.net <br>
